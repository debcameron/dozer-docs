# Monitoring your Application

Dozer UI provides its own dashboard to monitor the Application. It consists in different charts which show different parameters of your application.  On the menu, on the left side of the dashboard, you can find different tabs. Let's take a look at each of them.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The very first dashboard is an overview of many important settings of your application. 
This dashboard shows graphical representations of Sources, Stores, Sessions, Cache, and Pods.

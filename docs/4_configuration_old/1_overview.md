# Overview
You can configure `Connections`, `Sources` and `Endpoints` primarily, to setup dozer through YAML configuration.

```yaml
app_name: dozer-taxi-apis

# Define list of connections to use
connections:
  - config : !LocalStorage
      details:
        path: data
      tables:
        - !Table
          name: trips
          prefix: /trips
          file_type: parquet
          extension: .parquet
    name: ny_taxi

# You can define multiple transformations to perform on several connections
sql: |
  SELECT
    PULocationID as pickup_location,
    DOLocationID as dropoff_location,
    COUNT(PULocationID, DOLocationID) as total_trips,
    MIN(trip_time) as min_trip_time,
    MAX(trip_time) as max_trip_time
  INTO trips_cache
  FROM trips
  GROUP BY PULocationID, DOLocationID
  HAVING COUNT(PULocationID, DOLocationID) > 1000;


# Sources to be used. Here columns can be filtered
sources:
  - name: trips
    table_name: trips
    connection: !Ref ny_taxi
    columns:

# APIs to automatically publish
endpoints:
    # Endpoint entity name. Used in generating a gRPC service
  - name: trips_cache
    # Rest Endpoint
    path: /trips
    table_name: trips_cache
    # configure primary and secondary indexes
    index:
      primary_key:
        - pickup_location
        - dropoff_location
```

## Full Configuration

Below is a full configuration example that includes all possible parameters and its options.
> Note the `connections` config supports multiple connectors, and each connector have its own configuration options. Check out the [connectors](https://getdozer.io/docs/configuration/connectors) page for available connectors configuration.

```yaml

home_dir: "./.dozer"  # The directory where Dozer will store its process-related files. Default is "./.dozer".

cache_dir: "./.dozer/cache"  # The directory where Dozer will store its cache. Default is "./.dozer/cache".

# Define the connections to your data sources.
connections:
  - config : !LocalStorage  # The type of connection. In this case, it's a local storage.
      details:
        path: data  # The path to the directory containing the files
      tables:
        - !Table
          name: trips  # The name of the table in the local storage file.
          prefix: /trips  # The prefix for the file.
          file_type: parquet
          extension: .parquet
    name: ny_taxi  # The name of this connection. This will be used in the 'sources' section.

# Define the sources from where Dozer will ingest data.
sources:
  - name: trips  # The name of the source. This is used to distinguish between multiple sources.
    table_name: trips  # The name of the table in the source database.
    connection: !Ref ny_taxi  # The connection to use for this source. This should match a name defined in the 'connections' section.
    columns:  # The columns to use from the source table.
    schema:
    refresh_config: !RealTime  # The refresh configuration for this source.

# Define the SQL transformations to apply to the source data.

```

## Passing Environment Variables in Configuration

You can enclose the environment variables with double curly brackets,
like `{{ ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME }}` to use it in the configuration file.

For example:
```yaml
app_name: {{APP_NAME}}
```

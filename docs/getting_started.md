# Overview


Dozer is a Data API backend that embeds a streaming SQL engine, a low-latency data cache and generates gRPC and REST APIs that can be easily integrated in frontend applications.

**Core Features**

-  **Simple to Use**:
Dozer automatically generates a gRPC and REST APIs from your data sources. All you need is to write a YAML file with your data source configuration and the APIs you want to deploy. 

- **Combine data from multiple sources in real-time**:
As new data flows in, Dozer incrementally computes aggregations and joins, offering a far superior query experience than a traditional database. Dozer can in real-time join data coming from multiple data sources powering advanced use cases.

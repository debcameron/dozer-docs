# ðŸ“š Overview


Dozer is a Data Product backend that embeds a streaming SQL engine, a low-latency data cache and generates gRPC and REST APIs that can be easily integrated in frontend applications.

**Core Features**

* Simple to Use
Dozer generates a fully indexed gRPC and REST APIs automatically. All you need is to configure a YAML file with your data source configuration and the APIs you want to deploy. 

* Combine data from multiple sources
Dozer can in real-time join data coming from multiple data sources powering advanced use cases.

* Support a quasi-ANSI SQL. 
As new data flows in, Dozer incrementally computes aggregations and joins, offering a far superior query experience than a traditional database for these scenarios.

* Data API Endpoints
Note: The SQL you specify in the .yaml file does not run in the source database. Data is processed in real-time as it comes into Dozer.
